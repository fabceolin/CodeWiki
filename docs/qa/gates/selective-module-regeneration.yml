    status: PASS
    notes: "Local file operations only; path validation through tree matching; no auth/secrets changes"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Feature purpose IS performance optimization; selective regeneration faster than full; set operations efficient"

    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No explicit partial failure recovery; interrupted regeneration leaves inconsistent state. Consistent with existing behavior."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with pure functions; comprehensive test suite (49 tests); follows established patterns"
